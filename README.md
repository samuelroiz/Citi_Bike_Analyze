# Citi_Bike_Analyze

## About the project...
Given a new project for the New York Citi Bike Program, and responsible for overseeing the bike-sharing program in the United States. I have expectations to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program. Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. The public data organize and updated by the Citi Bike Data team. However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. Provided a set of data reports to provide the answers by using tableau.
